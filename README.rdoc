* http://github.com/mschuerig/index_lifter

== DESCRIPTION:

ActiveRecord utility class that disables database indexes during a block.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Speeds up large database imports and large-scale data generation
* Only use it in "maintenance mode", i.e., when there are no other
  connections to the database.
* If your application depends on unique indexes for working properly
  even during data generation, make sure they are not lifted.

== SYNOPSIS:

  desc "Populate the database with sample data"
  task :populate => :environment do

    retained_indexes = [
      'index_people_on_lastname_and_firstname',
      { :table => :movies, :columns => :title }
      { :table => 'people', :columns => ['lastname', :firstname] }
    ]

    ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
      IndexLifter.without_indexes(
        :movies,                       # Only consider indexes on these tables;
        :people,                       #   all tables by default.
        :except => retained_indexes,   # Don't lift these indexes
        :except_unique => true         # Don't lift unique indexes; default: false.
      ) do
        ActiveRecord::Base.silence do

          # import or generate large amounts of data here

        end
      end
    end
  end
